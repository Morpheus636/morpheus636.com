# Redownload v0.1.0a2 - Second Alpha Release

Redownload v0.1.0a2, the second alpha release, is written, built, and ready for community testing.

This version of Redownload can take either an archive.org link, or a relisten link\*, and download
all the tracks from it to the `./redownloads` directory. 

\* Relisten uses archive.org or a couple other sites to actually host the music. At this time,
Redownload will only work if it is hosted on archive.org, but this should be changed in the next release.


The builds for this version can be found [Here](https://github.com/Morpheus636/redownload/releases/tag/v0.1.0a2), and usage and installation documentation can be found [Here](https://github.com/Morpheus636/redownload/blob/v0.1.0a2/docs/usage.md). Contact me through my [Discord Server](https://discord.morpheus636.com) or open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Morpheus636/redownload/issues) in the repository for help, bugs, feature requests, or other feedback.

### Patch Notes
- Added support for downloading tracks from a relisten link.
