# Zeal CLI v1.1.0 Released

## Patch Notes:
- Added a config file located at `~/.local/share/zeal_cli/config.yml`
  - Right now, it only sets the Zeal docset directory, but more functionality will be added to it in the future.
- Added CLI options for interacting with the config file: `zeal-cli config {locate, view, reset, set}`
  - See `zeal-cli config --help` for information.
- Improved the documentation in the `--help` flag.
