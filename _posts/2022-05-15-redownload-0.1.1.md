# Redownload v0.1.1 Released
Redownload v0.1.1 is now available for download. This release is minor, containing only a bugfix, but I hope to
add some new features in the next release (v0.1.2)

## Patch Notes for Redownload v0.1.0
The following changes were implimented between v0.1.0 and v0.1.1:
- Fixed a bug causing an Exception to be raised when running on MacOS
  - There is still an open issue about a popup that says redownload "can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software". A workaround can be found [here](https://github.com/Morpheus636/morpheus636.com/discussions/39)

The builds for this version can be found [Here](https://github.com/Morpheus636/redownload/releases/tag/v0.1.1), and usage and installation documentation can be found [Here](https://github.com/Morpheus636/redownload/blob/v0.1.1/docs/usage.md). Contact me through my [Discord Server](https://discord.morpheus636.com) or [Forums](https://morpheus636.com/forums) for help and feedback, or open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Morpheus636/redownload/issues) in the repository for bugs and feature requests.
