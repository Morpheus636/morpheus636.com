# First Redownload Pre-Release - Redownload v0.1.0a1
I've finished the first alpha version of Redownload, a CLI tool for downloading music from relisten. In this first version, you need to manually find the associated archive.org link and provide it to Redownload, which will then locate the tracks from and download them automatically. In the next release, I plan to add support for using relisten links directly.

The builds for this version can be found [Here](https://github.com/Morpheus636/redownload/releases/tag/v0.1.0a1),and usage and installation documentation can be found [Here](https://github.com/Morpheus636/redownload/blob/v0.1.0a1/docs/usage.md). Contact me through my [Discord Server](https://discord.morpheus636.com) or open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Morpheus636/redownload/issues) in the repository for help, bugs, feature requests, or other feedback.

I'm not including any patch notes in this post, because this is the first release. Future versions will contain a changelog with a list of updates.
