# About
## Josh Levin - @Morpheus636

I'm a high school student with a lot of hobbies.
Right now, the little bit of time I have is focused on my programming projects,
but I'm also a student journalist, amateur photographer, mechanical keyboard
and PC hardware entheusiest, and a gamer (when time allows). 

I love all things Free and Open-Source, including linux. My daily driver OS
is Ubuntu 20.04 with some customizations.

## Programming Skills
I'm an advanced Python developer, primarily focused on CLI utilities and backend
web development. I also have minor experience with C++, JavaScript, Java, and Dart.

My other experience includes Docker, PostgreSQL, and advanced Linux and BASH usage.

## Portfolio
My portfolio can be found on [the projects page](/projects)
