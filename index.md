Hi, I'm Josh. I'm a high school junior (Shaker '24) with lots of hobbies and not enough time.
I'm a student journalist, working as an editor for [The Shakerite](https://shakerite.com). 
When I'm not working on the news, I spend lots of time programming and maintaining [open-source projects](/projects),
as well as taking pictures and moderating for communities across the internet.

I consider myself a "maker", although I've never called myself a "creative". I enjoy the technical side of making,
which is why I find myself attracted to backend development over frontend, journalistic writing over narrative writing,
photography over drawing, and engineering over model making. Nevertheless, I've always enjoyed making things, whether it be with
my hands in my workshop or my keyboard at my desk. I've always liked figuring out how things work and utilizing that knowledge for my own projects. 
I learn best by doing and I'm motivated most by the lesson that comes with amy solution.
