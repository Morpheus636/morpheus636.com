# Hey there, I'm Josh. 
I go by Morpheus636 across the internet, but you're welcome to call me 
Morpheus, Morph or Josh (Honestly, I don't care what you call me as long as I
know you're talking to me. What's in a name?)

I'm a high school student with too many hobbies. 
Right now, a lot of my attention is turned towards various programming 
projects, which I tend to jump between as I get tired of one of them.
I'm a full-time Ubuntu user, and I'm a lover of all things FOSS. I'm also an
amateur photographer, mechanical keyboard and PC hardware entheusiest, and 
a gamer (at least when I have time).

This blog is a place for me to talk about all my random hobbies, showcase
some of my work, and show off some of other people's projects that I enjoy
using.

# Contacting Me:
I moderate a 
couple of Discord servers, including 
[Python_Practice](https://discord.gg/bWf3y287S5) (a python programming and
technology-focused community) and 
[The Cult of Theta](https://invite.gg/thetavr) (a VR-focused community
specifically about Onward). If you want to come hang out
with me and chat, those are the places to do so. Other ways to contact me 
are linked below, and in the footer.
