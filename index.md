# Hey there, I'm Josh. 
I go by Morpheus636 across the internet, but you're welcome to call me 
Morpheus, Morph or Josh (Honestly, I don't care what you call me as long as I
know you're talking to me. What's in a name?)

I'm a high school student with too many hobbies. 
Right now, a lot of my attention is turned towards various programming 
projects, which I tend to jump between as I get tired of one of them.
I'm a full-time Ubuntu user, and I'm a lover of all things FOSS. I'm also an
amateur photographer, mechanical keyboard and PC hardware entheusiest, and 
a gamer (at least when I have time).

This blog is a place for me to talk about all my random hobbies, showcase
some of my work, and show off some of other people's projects that I enjoy
using. There is no comments section because I wouldn't check it 
if there was one, but if you've got something to tell me, you can shoot me a 
message or tag me on any of the platforms listed below, and I'll see it pretty 
quickly.

If you're looking to hang out and chat with me, Discord is the right place
to be. I moderate in
[Python_Practice](https://discord.gg/bWf3y287S5) (a python programming and
technology-focused community) and 
[The Cult of Theta](https://invite.gg/thetavr) (a community focused on the VR game Onward), so you're welcome to stop by in either of those
servers.
