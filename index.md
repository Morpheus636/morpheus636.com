# About
## Josh Levin - @Morpheus636

Hi, I'm Josh. I'm a 16-year-old high school student with too many hobbies and not enough time.
I'm a student journalist, working as an editor for [The Shakerite](https://shakerite.com). When I'm not doing that, I spend my time programming and maintaining various [open-source projects](/projects), as well as taking pictures and moderating for various communities across the internet.
