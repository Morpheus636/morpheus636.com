# About
## Josh Levin - @Morpheus636

I'm a 16-year-old high school student with too many hobbies and not enough time.
Most of that time is spent on programming and journalism, but I'm also an
ametueur photographer and a general technology entheusiest. I'm a lover of
 all things Free and Open-Source, including Linux, and I daily-drive Ubuntu 20.04.

My resume can be found [here](/resume) and a list of my current projects (with links)
can be found [here](/projects)
